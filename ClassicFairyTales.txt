Once upon a time, in a quiet kingdom wrapped in mist, there lived an owl who could read dreams.

Each night, the villagers placed their worries beneath their pillows, and the owl would fly through the moonlight, collecting them one by one.

He stitched the broken pieces of hope into feathers of light, letting them fall at dawn like snowflakes over the land.

And so, peace reignedâ€”not because trouble vanished, but because someone always listened.

Once, a tree whispered to the stars, longing for wings. The stars replied in silence, but the wind carried its dreams across the mountains.
